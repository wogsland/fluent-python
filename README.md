# Fluent Python

When going through a coding book, I like to put notes and examples and such in a repo saved for later.

[HTML version I'm reading](https://library.oreilly.com/book/0636920032519/fluent-python/toc.xhtml)

I got the example-code [here](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code), where it's probably been updated.
